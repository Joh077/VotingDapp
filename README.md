## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- MetaMask or compatible Ethereum wallet
- Sepolia testnet ETH for testing

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

> git clone https://github.com/Joh077/VotingDapp.git

> cd VotingDapp

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

#### Backend Setup:


> cd backend

> npm install

#### Frontend Setup:


> cd frontend/my-app

> npm install

### 3️⃣ Environment Configuration

#### Backend (.env):

env

SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_rpc_url
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key

#### Frontend (constants/index.js):

javascript 

export const contractAddress = "0xF87f63D55e5ED614b91E176Dda9FF6eeFe5a59B1";
export const contractAbi = [...]; 
// ABI from contract compilation

### 4️⃣ Deploy Smart Contract (Optional)


> cd backend

> npx hardhat compile

> npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/voting.js --network sepolia --verify

### 5️⃣ Run the Application


> cd frontend/my-app

> npm run dev

Visit http://localhost:3000 and connect your wallet to start voting!

## 📖 Usage Guide

### For Contract Owner

1. ***Deploy Contract***: Deploy using Hardhat to your preferred network
2. ***Register Voters***: Add eligible voter addresses in Phase 0
3. ***Start Proposal Phase***: Transition to Phase 1 for proposal submission
4. ***Close Proposals***: Move to Phase 2 after sufficient proposals
5. ***Start Voting***: Begin the voting session (Phase 3)
6. ***End Voting***: Close voting and move to Phase 4
7. ***Tally Votes***: Execute final tally to reveal results (Phase 5)

### For Voters

1. ***Connect Wallet***: Use RainbowKit to connect your Ethereum wallet
2. ***Check Registration***: Verify your address is registered by the owner
3. ***Submit Proposals***: Add your proposals during Phase 1
4. ***Cast Vote***: Vote for your preferred proposal during Phase 3
5. ***View Results***: Check the final results and statistics after tallying

### Voting Options

- ***Regular Proposals***: Vote for community-submitted proposals
- ***Blank Vote***: Choose abstention if no proposal appeals to you
- ***One Vote Per Address***: Each registered voter gets exactly one vote


## 🔧 Smart Contract Details

### Contract Address (Sepolia)

0xF87f63D55e5ED614b91E176Dda9FF6eeFe5a59B1

### Key Functions

| Function           | Access        | Description           |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------          |
| addVoter(address)  | Owner         | Register a new voter  |
| addVoter(address)  | Voters        | Submit a proposal     |
| addVoter(address)  | Voters        | Cast a vote           |
| addVoter(address)  | Owner         | Finalize results      |


### Events

- VoterRegistered(address) - New voter registered
- ProposalRegistered(uint) - New proposal added
- Voted(address, uint) - Vote cast
- WorkflowStatusChange(uint, uint) - Phase transition

### Gas Optimizations

- Pre-calculated storage addresses for voter data
- Real-time winner calculation (no loops in tallyVotes)
- Custom errors instead of strings
- Efficient event emission


## 🧪 Testing

### Run Smart Contract Tests


>cd backend

>npx hardhat test

### Test Coverage Areas
